# 3D-Bakery-Store
A 3-D Website of a bakery store where the user is able to relate more with the products improving the overall user experience.

## Description
* As we know the world is changing at very rapid speed therefore the way we present our ideas should change, similarly Our marketing strategy should change.
So here we are with some interesting ideas that are to present things in a more eye-catching way in 3D models creating a great visual experience for the user.
* We tried to create a website for Bakery stores with in-built cart to order stuff from the store and customers will also have a benefit of customizing the products according to their needs.
* The Bakery Store will contain bakery items like ice-creams, donuts, pan cakes, etc. Users can view these items in 3D, and rotate items to view them from different angles.
